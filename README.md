# Tabletop RPG Tools

A collection of tools useful in a variety of TTRPGs.

These tools are primarily intended for use by a DM of DND 5e, but nearly all of these tools can be useful for a wide variety of other uses as well (including, but not limited to, DND players, DMs and players of other TTRPGs, online RPGs, games of chance, and storytelling).

Note: A variety of licenses are used in this repository. Each file will have a SPDX-License-Identifier comment or other indicator in it detailing which license applies to each file. For binary files or files that otherwise cannot be conveniently labeled with a license, the LICENSE file will indicate the license for that file. A LICENSE file is included in each directory when all files in that directory share a license. If you notice a file without any license details, let me know and I will fix the file with an appropriate label.
