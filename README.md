# Tabletop RPG Tools

A collection of tools useful in a variety of TTRPGs.

These tools are primarily intended for use by a DM of D&D 5e, but nearly all of these tools can be useful for a wide variety of other uses as well (including, but not limited to, D&D players, DMs and players of other TTRPGs, online RPGs, games of chance, and storytelling).

At the moment, these tools will not be useful to people who are not Javascript developers, but I plan on creating accessible sites for DMs and players that anyone will be able to use. If you are a developer and would like to use any of these files to help create your own site (free or not), feel free to! The more good D&D tools out there, the better! Please let me know if you do this - I'd be very interested to see what you come up with. If you make enhancements to anything I've done, please consider submitting pull requests to share you work back.

WARNING: This project is very much a WIP and there will likely be substantial changes. If you make use of any of these classes, be very careful when pulling updates - there is a very high risk that I will make non-backwards-compatible changes (at least in the short-term; eventually I hope that most of this becomes fairly stable).

## Licensing
These tools are available under the MIT License (see LICENSE).

It is expected that some content in this repository will be licensed under other licenses in the future, including the Open Game License. If and when this happens, I will do my best to separate and label any non-MIT-licensed content in a clear way.

All source files should include an SPDX-License-Identifier to help make it clear which license(s) apply to which files - if this is missing from any file, please let me know so I can correct this.

## Dice
Tools to mimic things you would do with dice.


## Dungeon
A random dungeon generator.


### Special Thanks
This dungeon generator was heavily inspired by dungeon.pl, a perl Random Dungeon Generator by drow.

The original dungeon.pl can be found here: https://donjon.bin.sh


## Imaging
Classes to make creating simple SVG and other images a little easier. This isn't useful for DMs/Players directly, but is used by the dungeon classes to create an image of the dungeon, and may be used for other aspects as well (perhaps drawing simulated dice rolls or other graphics).
